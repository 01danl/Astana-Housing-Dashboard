This project is a personal attempt to collect, clean, and analyze real estate data from Krisha.kz â€” one of the most popular property platforms in Kazakhstan.

The main goal is to extract apartment listings in Astana, build a structured dataset (CSV), and later use it for price analytics, visualizations, and machine learning (price prediction, heatmaps by district, etc).

The data includes:

	â€¢	Price, area, number of rooms
	â€¢	Floor, district, address
	â€¢	Description and other useful metadata

Eventually, the idea is to turn this into a basic real estate dashboard â€” with interactive maps and filters.

ðŸš§ Status

The project is currently paused, but will be continued and updated in future.
This is a WIP (work-in-progress) repository created as part of personal learning in data scraping and ML pipelines.

Feel free to reach out or fork the repo if youâ€™re interested in real estate data or similar projects.
This is a personal learning project, but contributions are welcome in the future.
